# Pair-Trading-Strategy
Pair trading is a trading strategy that involves buying and selling two highly correlated financial instruments simultaneously in order to profit from the difference in their prices. The two instruments are typically in the same sector or industry and have similar market capitalizations. The goal of pair trading is to profit from the relative outperformance or underperformance of one instrument compared to the other.

The pair trading strategy involves identifying a pair of instruments that have a strong correlation, meaning that their prices tend to move in the same direction over time. Once a pair has been identified, the trader will go long on one instrument and short on the other. The idea is that if one instrument outperforms the other, the profits from the winning trade will offset the losses from the losing trade, resulting in a net profit.

Pair trading requires a lot of analysis and research to identify the right pairs to trade, and it requires constant monitoring to ensure that the correlation between the instruments remains strong. It is a popular strategy among hedge funds and institutional investors, but it can also be used by individual traders.

Note:It is important to note that mean-reversion trading strategies are not foolproof and can be subject to significant risks. For example, if the price of the security or portfolio continues to move away from its mean, losses can accumulate rapidly. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards associated with any trading strategy before implementing it.
